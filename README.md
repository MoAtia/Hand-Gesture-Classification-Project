# ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe and Machine Learning

This project detects and classifies hand gestures in real-time using a laptop camera. It uses **MediaPipe** to extract hand landmarks, and **machine learning models** (SVM, KNN, Random Forest) to recognize gestures.

## 🎯 Features

- Real-time hand gesture prediction from webcam
- Trained on MediaPipe hand landmarks
- Grid search for model selection
- Interactive and reproducible training with Jupyter
- Lightweight & fast — works on most laptops
